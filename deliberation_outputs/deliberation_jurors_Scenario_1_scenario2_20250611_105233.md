## Case Details

Scenario 2: 
Background: Tomer and Stan are accused of murder. The prosecution claims they were the only ones seen in the store shortly before the murder and fleeing the scene afterward.
Presenting the Decisive Evidence: The trial is underway. The prosecution has presented the Sheriff's testimony confirming that Tomer and Stan were identified at the scene and fled, along with eyewitness testimonies. The Sheriff also testified that there was no active security camera in the store.
Presenting the Defense's Evidence: Inbar, the lawyer, calls Mr. Alon, the manager of a neighboring convenience store located across the street, to the witness stand. Inbar: "Mr. Alon, how long have you managed 'the tasty honey' store?" Mr. Alon: "About 15 years, Your Honor." Inbar: "Are there security cameras outside your store?" Mr. Alon: "Yes, I have a camera that films the main road and the entrance to my store, for security reasons." Inbar: "And on the morning of the incident, around 11:00 AM, was this camera active?" Mr. Alon: "Yes, it's always active." Inbar: "Did you check the footage from that morning?" Mr. Alon: "Absolutely. The police asked, but they didn't see anything unusual there." Inbar: "Your Honor, I would like to present to the court security footage received from Mr. Alon. The footage shows the time when Tomer and Stan left the 'Sac-O-Suds' store." The video is projected onto a large screen. Tomer and Stan's car is clearly seen driving away. A few seconds later, another person, who is neither Tomer nor Stan, is seen hastily exiting the nearby "Sac-O-Suds" store. Their face is not completely clear due to the distance, but it is clear that this is a completely different person. They get into a black car parked on the other side of the road and drive away quickly. Inbar: "Mr. Alon, is the person we saw in the video exiting the 'Sac-O-Suds' store one of the two defendants sitting here?" Mr. Alon: "No, sir. It's not them." Inbar: "Your Honor, please note: this video clearly proves that Tomer and Stan left the scene before the murder was committed, and that another person, unrelated to them, exited the store shortly thereafter. This indicates that another person is the killer." Inbar: "In light of the video, the Sheriff will need to re-investigate the eyewitness testimonies and examine the precise timing of the events."

## Deliberation Process

<span style="color: #2E8B57"><strong>Moderator:</strong></span> === JURY DELIBERATION BEGINS ===

<span style="color: #2E8B57"><strong>Moderator:</strong></span> === DELIBERATION ROUND 1 ===

<span style="color: #4169E1"><strong>Casey Brown:</strong></span> Alright, folks, let's get this over with. That video seems pretty clear to me. If it wasn't them in the store when the murder happened, I don't see how we can convict them.

<span style="color: #DC143C"><strong>Mitchell Johnson:</strong></span> Well, now, Casey's got a point. That video does throw a wrench into things. We gotta figure out if that video is credible and if the timing lines up like the defense is saying. This might take a bit, but we need to be thorough to get to the truth.

<span style="color: #FF8C00"><strong>Heather Perez:</strong></span> Well, now hold on a minute, Casey and Mitchell. That video *is* interesting, but I don't think we should rush to any conclusions just yet. We need to really dissect that video, maybe watch it a few more times, and think about *why* the police didn't find it themselves. I think we need to really consider *all* the evidence before making a decision, not just jump on the bandwagon of one video.

<span style="color: #2E8B57"><strong>Moderator:</strong></span> === DELIBERATION ROUND 2 ===

<span style="color: #4169E1"><strong>Casey Brown:</strong></span> Alright, alright, I hear you, Heather. But the video *does* show someone else leaving the store. Maybe the cops just missed it? I still think it raises enough doubt for me to say not guilty. Let's just watch the video again and then vote, I'm starving.

<span style="color: #DC143C"><strong>Mitchell Johnson:</strong></span> Hold on there, Casey. While that video is compelling, Heather's right, we can't rush this. Let's watch that video again like she suggested, paying close attention to the time stamps and that other person's actions. Maybe then we can get a better sense of whether that video truly exonerates Tomer and Stan, or if there's something else we're missing.

<span style="color: #FF8C00"><strong>Heather Perez:</strong></span> Exactly! Everyone's so quick to jump to conclusions. I think we need to really unpack the Sheriff's testimony *and* the manager's. Maybe the Sheriff missed the video, but *why*? Something feels off, and we owe it to ourselves to really dig deep before we just let these two go.

<span style="color: #2E8B57"><strong>Moderator:</strong></span> === DELIBERATION ROUND 3 ===

<span style="color: #4169E1"><strong>Casey Brown:</strong></span> Okay, okay, I get it. We gotta be thorough. But honestly, that video is pretty convincing. Let's watch it again, focus on the timestamps like Mitchell said, and then let's vote. I'm still leaning not guilty, but I'm willing to look closer just to get this over with.

<span style="color: #DC143C"><strong>Mitchell Johnson:</strong></span> Alright, let's watch that video again like we talked about. Casey's right, the timestamps are important, but I want to pay close attention to how long after Tomer and Stan leave that other person comes out. If it's a short time, it definitely throws the Sheriff's testimony into question, and we need to seriously consider reasonable doubt.

<span style="color: #FF8C00"><strong>Heather Perez:</strong></span> Well, I'm glad we're finally taking this seriously! I agree we need to watch the video again, of course, but I still think we're glossing over the Sheriff's initial investigation. Let's not forget, he identified them at the scene, so where did he go wrong? I think we need to ask ourselves whether the Sheriff was in cahoots with the owner!

<span style="color: #2E8B57"><strong>Moderator:</strong></span> === COLLECTING FINAL VERDICTS ===

<span style="color: #8B0000"><strong>Final_Verdict:</strong></span> === FINAL VERDICTS ===
Casey Brown: VERDICT: NOT GUILTY - The video evidence introduces reasonable doubt, showing another person leaving the scene after the defendants.
Mitchell Johnson: VERDICT: NOT GUILTY - The video evidence introduces reasonable doubt by showing another person leaving the store after the defendants, suggesting someone else could be the perpetrator.
Heather Perez: VERDICT: NOT GUILTY - This video evidence introduces reasonable doubt, and we need to thoroughly analyze every frame and angle to ensure we aren't missing any crucial details before rushing to a verdict.

FINAL TALLY: 0 Guilty, 3 Not Guilty
JURY DECISION: NOT GUILTY
