<p>Scenario 3: 
Background: Tomer and Stan are accused of murder. The prosecution relies on circumstantial evidence and efforts of eyewitnesses.
Presenting the Decisive Evidence: The trial is underway. The prosecution has presented circumstantial evidence and claimed the existence of some motive, although it was not entirely clear. Inbar managed to discredit some of the eyewitness testimonies, but doubt still exists.
Presenting the Prosecution&#39;s New Evidence: The prosecutor, Oren, calls the police detective responsible for collecting evidence from the scene, Detective Smith, to the witness stand. Oren: &quot;Detective Smith, did you find any additional evidence at the crime scene that has not been revealed until now?&quot; Detective Smith: &quot;Yes, sir. After a thorough additional search, we found a small, hidden item inside a concealed pocket in the jacket worn by the defendant, Tomer Gambino.&quot; Oren: &quot;And what is this item?&quot; Detective Smith: &quot;It&#39;s a receipt.&quot; Oren: &quot;Can you describe the receipt, Detective Smith?&quot; Detective Smith: &quot;It&#39;s a small, printed receipt from a local auto parts store.&quot; Oren: &quot;Can you tell us when the purchase was made according to the receipt?&quot; Detective Smith: &quot;Yes, sir. The date is the morning of the murder, about an hour before the defendants arrived at &#39;Sac-O-Suds&#39;.&quot; Oren: &quot;And what was purchased according to the receipt?&quot; Detective Smith: &quot;Thick work gloves, a specific type of industrial cleaning solution, and... a gun silencer were purchased.&quot; Sounds of commotion rise in the courtroom. Inbar and Lisa are stunned. Oren: &quot;Detective Smith, are these items, and in particular the silencer, related to how the murder was committed?&quot; Detective Smith: &quot;Absolutely, sir. The bullet found in the victim&#39;s body underwent a slight modification indicating the use of a silencer, and the cleaning solution is similar to a substance found on the floor near the cash register.&quot;</p>

<p><span style="color: #2E8B57"><strong>Moderator:</strong></span> === DELIBERATION ROUND 1 ===</p>
<p><span style="color: #4169E1"><strong>Trisha Fox:</strong></span> Well, now, this new evidence changes things quite a bit. That receipt for the silencer, gloves, and cleaning solution... that&#39;s mighty incriminating, especially since the detective said the silencer matches the bullet. This might be the break in the case we needed, but we still need to consider everything else.</p>
<p><span style="color: #DC143C"><strong>Allen Johnson:</strong></span> Okay, this new evidence definitely throws a wrench in things. The receipt is pretty damning, especially the silencer and the cleaning solution matching what was found at the scene. I agree with Trisha, we need to weigh this new information against everything else we&#39;ve heard, but it&#39;s hard to ignore such direct evidence.</p>
<p><span style="color: #FF8C00"><strong>Catherine Moore:</strong></span> This new evidence is certainly compelling. The receipt linking Tomer to the silencer and cleaning solution, especially with the detective&#39;s confirmation of their relevance to the crime, makes a strong case. I agree with Trisha and Allen that we need to consider this in light of the previous evidence, but it&#39;s hard to dismiss such a direct connection.</p>
<p><span style="color: #9932CC"><strong>Laura Owens:</strong></span> Okay, this receipt definitely paints a grim picture for Tomer. The silencer and cleaning solution being linked to the crime scene is pretty hard to ignore. I think we still need to consider the earlier doubts raised about the eyewitnesses, but this new evidence is a major point in the prosecution&#39;s favor.</p>
<p><span style="color: #2E8B57"><strong>Moderator:</strong></span> === DELIBERATION ROUND 2 ===</p>
<p><span style="color: #4169E1"><strong>Trisha Fox:</strong></span> Alright, folks, I hear you all loud and clear. That receipt is hard to ignore, especially with the detective confirming the silencer and cleaning solution match the crime scene. But, let&#39;s not throw out the baby with the bathwater; we still need to remember those shaky eyewitness accounts Inbar brought up. This new evidence puts a heavy weight on Tomer, but we need to make sure we&#39;re balancing it with everything else before we come to a decision.</p>
<p><span style="color: #DC143C"><strong>Allen Johnson:</strong></span> Okay, so the receipt is a big problem for Tomer, no doubt. But Trisha&#39;s right, we can&#39;t just forget about Inbar&#39;s work discrediting those eyewitnesses. We need to figure out if this new evidence is enough to outweigh the doubts we still have about the initial testimony.</p>
<p><span style="color: #FF8C00"><strong>Catherine Moore:</strong></span> I agree with Trisha and Allen - the receipt is incredibly damaging to Tomer, and the link to the silencer and cleaning solution is hard to ignore. However, Inbar did raise some valid points about the eyewitness accounts. We need to carefully consider if this new evidence, while strong, completely overrides the questions surrounding the initial testimony.</p>
<p><span style="color: #9932CC"><strong>Laura Owens:</strong></span> Alright, I&#39;m with you guys. This receipt is a serious blow to Tomer, especially with the detective confirming the links to the crime. But those doubts about the eyewitnesses are still nagging at me. We need to really weigh whether this receipt, as damning as it seems, completely erases the questions about the initial testimony before we can be sure.</p>
<p><span style="color: #2E8B57"><strong>Moderator:</strong></span> === DELIBERATION ROUND 3 ===</p>
<p><span style="color: #4169E1"><strong>Trisha Fox:</strong></span> Okay, folks, that receipt and Detective Smith&#39;s testimony paint a grim picture for Tomer. While I appreciate Inbar&#39;s work on those eyewitness accounts, this new evidence linking Tomer directly to the silencer and cleaning solution is hard to dismiss. It seems the weight of the evidence is shifting, and we need to seriously consider if reasonable doubt still exists for Tomer, given this new information.</p>
<p><span style="color: #DC143C"><strong>Allen Johnson:</strong></span> Okay, this receipt is definitely a game changer. While I still value Inbar&#39;s work on the eyewitness accounts, the tangible link between Tomer, the silencer, and the cleaning solution is difficult to ignore. We need to really dig deep and ask ourselves if those initial doubts are strong enough to create reasonable doubt in light of this new evidence.</p>
<p><span style="color: #FF8C00"><strong>Catherine Moore:</strong></span> This receipt is definitely a turning point, and the connection to the silencer and cleaning solution is pretty damning. While I still remember Inbar&#39;s points about the eyewitnesses, it&#39;s getting harder to ignore this direct link. We really need to decide if those initial doubts are enough to outweigh this new, very concrete evidence.</p>
<p><span style="color: #9932CC"><strong>Laura Owens:</strong></span> Okay, everyone, I&#39;m finding it tough to reconcile the receipt with the earlier doubts about the eyewitnesses. While Inbar poked holes in their stories, this new evidence directly links Tomer to the crime, making it harder to maintain reasonable doubt, especially given the detective&#39;s testimony connecting the silencer and cleaning solution.</p>

<p><span style="color: #8B0000"><strong>Final_Verdict:</strong></span> === FINAL VERDICTS ===
Trisha Fox: VERDICT: GUILTY - The receipt for the gloves, cleaning solution, and especially the silencer, purchased shortly before the murder and matching evidence at the scene, is too strong to ignore.
Allen Johnson: VERDICT: GUILTY - The receipt showing the purchase of a silencer, gloves, and cleaning solution shortly before the murder, directly linking Tomer to the crime, outweighs the previously circumstantial evidence and discredited testimonies.
Catherine Moore: VERDICT: GUILTY - The new evidence of the silencer receipt found on Tomer, along with the gloves and cleaning solution, directly links him to the crime and outweighs the previous doubts.
Laura Owens: VERDICT: GUILTY - The newly presented evidence of the silencer receipt, purchased shortly before the murder, and the cleaning solution matching the substance at the scene, strongly implicates Tomer in the crime.</p>
